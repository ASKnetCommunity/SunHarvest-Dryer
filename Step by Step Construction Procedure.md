## Construction Steps

### 1. Build the Frame
- Measure the frame to be 193 cm in length and 96.5 cm in width.
- Ensure one side is higher to allow rainwater runoff and maximize light exposure.
- Create inlets and outlets for air circulation.

### 2. Install the Trays
- Secure mesh trays inside the frame, allowing space for airflow.
- Ensure the trays are stable and can support food items.

### 3. Attach the Cover
- Use transparent plastic or glass to cover the frame, attaching it with hinges for easy access.

### 4. Cover the Inner Surface with a Black DPC Polythene
- Paint or cover the interior with black material to maximize heat absorption.

### 5. Add Ventilation
- Drill holes at the bottom and top for airflow, and consider adjustable vents for control.

### 6. Optional Enhancements
- Add reflective surfaces or a thermometer for better performance.
