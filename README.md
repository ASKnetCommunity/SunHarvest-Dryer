# SunHarvest Dryer (SHD)
The **SunHarvest Dryer** harnesses the abundant power of the sun to dehydrate various food items, effectively preserving them for extended periods. This technology not only reduces dependency on traditional methods, such as open-air drying, which can be inefficient and prone to animals that feed on them, reducing their quantity, but also mitigates the risk of contamination. By installing SunHarvest Dryers, we aim to empower refugees to preserve their harvests more effectively, contributing to the reduction of post-harvest losses and fostering economic growth.

This dryer aids small-scale farmers in minimizing post-harvest losses and reduces the time spent moving seeds in and out for drying. This contributes to the achievement of **SDG Goal 13**. By equipping the community with the skills and methodologies for DIY (Do It Yourself) and DIWO (Do It With Others), we empower them to take sustainable action.

**SunHarvest Dryer Prototype**

The construction team had 14 youth from the community, with 7 females leading the development of the SunHarvest Dryer prototype and 7 males contributing as well. Amoko is responsible for documentation, while Eunice handles media production.


## Principles of Operation

The SunHarvest Dryer works by capturing solar radiation, converting it to heat, and trapping it inside the dryer. This heat, combined with proper ventilation, removes moisture from food items placed on trays. The black interior surfaces absorb more heat, while the transparent cover allows sunlight in, creating a greenhouse effect.

The key principles involved are:
- **Heat Absorption**: The interior is painted black to maximize heat absorption.
- **Ventilation**: Vents are placed to facilitate airflow, allowing moisture to escape.
- **Dehydration**: The heat and airflow work together to evaporate water from the food.

## Construction Steps

### 1. **Build the Frame**
   - Leave about 50 cm (19.65 inches) to prevent flowing water from entering into the SunHarvest Dryer.
   - Measure the length and width of the frame to be 193 cm and 96.5 cm respectively, ensuring the width is about half the length of the SunHarvest Dryer.
   - One of the heights should be lower than the other on either side to allow rainwater to flow off the dryer and position it in the best position to ensure maximum light penetration.
   - Ensure to create an inlet at the bottom and an outlet at the top part of the dryer to allow in cool air and let out warm air.

### 2. **Install the Trays**
   - Inside the frame, install mesh trays with enough space between them for air to circulate.
   - Secure the trays so they can support the weight of the food.

### 3. **Attach the Cover**
   - Use transparent plastic or glass to cover the top of the frame.
   - Attach the cover with hinges so it can be opened and closed easily for loading and unloading food.

### 4. **Cover the Inner Surface with a Black DPC Polythene**
   - Alternatively, paint the inner surfaces of the dryer black to absorb maximum heat from the sun.
   - It is also recommendable to use black-painted iron sheets since they conduct and absorb more heat.

### 5. **Add Ventilation**
   - Drill small holes at the bottom and top of the dryer for airflow.
   - Consider installing adjustable vents to control the amount of air entering and leaving the dryer.

### 6. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Add reflective surfaces like aluminum foil inside the dryer to increase sunlight exposure.
   - Install a thermometer to keep track of the internal temperature for optimal drying conditions.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Prepare the Food**: Slice fruits, vegetables, or herbs evenly to ensure consistent drying. Thicker slices may take longer to dry.
2. **Arrange on Trays**: Place the food items on the mesh trays in a single layer without overlapping.
3. **Position the Dryer**: Place the SunHarvest Dryer in a sunny location, ideally where it will receive direct sunlight for most of the day.
4. **Monitor Drying**: Check the food periodically, rotating trays if necessary to ensure even drying.
5. **Harvest Dried Food**: Once the food reaches the desired dryness, remove it from the dryer and store it in airtight containers.

## Safety Tips
- **Monitor Temperature**: Keep an eye on the internal temperature to avoid overheating and potential fire hazards.
- **Ventilation**: Ensure proper ventilation to prevent moisture buildup, which could lead to mold growth.
- **Food Safety**: Wash food items thoroughly before drying to remove any contaminants.

## Maintenance
- **Regular Cleaning**: Clean the trays and interior surfaces after each use to prevent mold and bacteria buildup.
- **Inspect for Damage**: Regularly check the dryer for any damage to the frame, cover, or vents, and repair as needed.
- **Seasonal Maintenance**: Before storing the dryer for the season, clean it thoroughly and inspect all components.

## Potential Modifications
- **Larger Capacity**: Expand the size of the dryer for larger batches of food.
- **Automated Ventilation**: Add a small solar-powered fan for improved air circulation.
- **Temperature Control**: Install a thermostat to regulate the internal temperature automatically.
