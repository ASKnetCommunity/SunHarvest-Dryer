## Step 1: Build the Frame

The first step is constructing the main frame, which supports the entire structure of the solar dryer.

1. **Measure the frame**: 
   - The frame should be 193 cm in length and 96.5 cm in width. One side must be higher to allow rainwater runoff and maximize sunlight exposure.
2. **Cut the timber**: 
   - Use a saw to cut your timber pieces according to the measured dimensions.
3. **Assemble the frame**:
   - Secure the pieces together with nails and wood glue.

## Step 2: Install the Trays

Now, you'll add the trays that will hold the food items.

1. **Cut the wire mesh** to fit within the frame.
2. **Create tray frames** using smaller wood pieces, ensuring a stable structure.
3. **Install the trays** at various levels within the frame.



## Step 3: Cover the Inner Surface with Black DPC Polythene

The black interior will absorb more heat and improve the drying efficiency.

1. **Measure and cut** the black DPC polythene.
2. **Cover the inner walls** of the dryer by attaching the polythene tightly across the surface.

## Step 4: Attach the Cover

To allow sunlight to enter and trap heat inside the dryer, you'll need to cover the frame.

1. **Cut UV-resistant transparent polythene** or glass to fit the top of the frame.
2. **Attach the cover** with hinges or fasteners for easy access.

## Step 5: Add Ventilation

Proper ventilation helps in drying food by allowing moisture to escape.

1. **Drill holes** for air circulation at the top and bottom.
2. **Install vents with mesh** to prevent insects from entering the dryer.

## Step 6: Optional Enhancements

You can enhance your dryer for better efficiency:

1. **Add a thermometer** to monitor the internal temperature.
2. **Reflective surfaces** can be added to increase heat retention.

## Finished Product

Once all steps are complete, your SunHarvest Dryer is ready to use!
