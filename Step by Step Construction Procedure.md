## Step 1: sitting  and measurement.

-Identify a suitable loction for the solar dryer, considering sunlight exposure and accessiblility.

-Measure the area where the dryer will be constructed
## STEP 2: SETTING THE FRAMEWORK

. Constructe a rectangular frame using wooden or metal beams, based on the mesaured areas.
.Ensure the frame is sturdy and level.

## STEP 3: ATTACHING WIRE MESH


.Cut wiremish to fit the frame, leaving some excess for folding.

.attache the wire mesh to the frame using nails or wire

## STEP 4: SECURING WIRE MESH

. fold the excess wire mesh over the frame and nail it in place

. ensure the mesh is tight and evenly spaced.
## STEP 5: COVERING WITH DPC (Durable plactic coasting)

. cut DPC sheets to fit the top and sides of thr eframe

.cover the wiremesh with DPC starting from the top and working down

. ensure a tight seal to prevent air leaks.

##STEP 6: ADDING BLACK DPC cover all the frame Body

. cut a block DPC to fit all the body dryer 


. cover all the side by side with block DPC sheet,enusing a tight seal..

## STEEP 7: ADDING WHITE DPC OR glass to cover the TOP.

. cut a white DPC sheet OR Glass to fitz the top of the dryer

.Cover the top with the white DPC sheet or glass, ensuring a tight seal.

## STEP 8: CREATEING  INLET AND OUTLET AIR VENTS

. Cut two small vents, one for inlet air and outlet air

. attach the vents to the side sides of the dryer, ensuringproper airflow.

## STEP 9: FINAL ASSEMBY AND TESTING

.Assemble all components,ensuring atight seal and proper airflow.

.Test the solar dryer, making any necessary adjumanets.

NOTE: DPC stands for Durable plastic coasting which is used to cover the wire mesh and provide insulation. The block DPC cover absorbs heat, while the white DPC or glass cover reflects sunlight and helps retain heat.
