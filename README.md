# SunHarvest Dryer (SHD)

The **SunHarvest Dryer** is an innovative solution that leverages solar energy to dehydrate and preserve various food items. This technology empowers communities, particularly in refugee settlements, to reduce post-harvest losses and improve food security. By constructing SunHarvest Dryers, we aim to foster sustainable practices, contributing to both economic growth and environmental conservation.

## Introduction

The SunHarvest Dryer harnesses the sun's power to preserve food, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional drying methods. This OER provides step-by-step instructions for building and using the dryer, promoting self-reliance and environmental sustainability.

## Principles of Operation

The SunHarvest Dryer operates by:
- **Heat Absorption**: The black interior surfaces absorb heat from the sun.
- **Ventilation**: Proper airflow is facilitated by vents to remove moisture.
- **Dehydration**: The heat and airflow work together to dry food items efficiently.

## Construction Steps

### 1. Build the Frame
- Measure the frame to be 193 cm in length and 96.5 cm in width.
- Ensure one side is higher to allow rainwater runoff and maximize light exposure.
- Create inlets and outlets for air circulation.

### 2. Install the Trays
- Secure mesh trays inside the frame, allowing space for airflow.
- Ensure the trays are stable and can support food items.

### 3. Attach the Cover
- Use transparent plastic or glass to cover the frame, attaching it with hinges for easy access.

### 4. Cover the Inner Surface with a Black DPC Polythene
- Paint or cover the interior with black material to maximize heat absorption.

### 5. Add Ventilation
- Drill holes at the bottom and top for airflow, and consider adjustable vents for control.

### 6. Optional Enhancements
- Add reflective surfaces or a thermometer for better performance.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Prepare the Food**: Slice food items evenly.
2. **Arrange on Trays**: Place the food on the trays in a single layer.
3. **Position the Dryer**: Place the dryer in direct sunlight.
4. **Monitor Drying**: Check periodically and rotate trays if necessary.
5. **Harvest Dried Food**: Store dried food in airtight containers.

## Safety Tips

- Monitor temperature to avoid overheating.
- Ensure proper ventilation to prevent mold growth.
- Clean food items thoroughly before drying.

## Maintenance

- Clean the trays and interior regularly.
- Inspect the dryer for damage and repair as needed.
- Perform seasonal maintenance before storage.

## Potential Modifications

- Expand the dryer size for larger capacity.
- Add solar-powered fans for better ventilation.
- Install a thermostat for automatic temperature control.
